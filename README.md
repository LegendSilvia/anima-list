## About

**Anima List** is a modern web application for browsing seasonal anime, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It fetches data from the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to display up-to-date anime information, including cover art, genres, ratings, and more. Users can explore anime by season and year, view detailed cards for each title, and add shows to their personal watchlist.

Key features:
- Browse anime by season and year
- Responsive, mobile-friendly UI
- Rich anime cards with genres, ratings, and status
- Add anime to your watchlist (UI only, backend coming soon)
- Built with Next.js App Router and Tailwind CSS

This project is open source and intended for personal-learning.
